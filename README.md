# UPMCD
UPMCD can be called an adaptation of MESE for modern operating systems, they are based on similar mathematical models, but there are some changes. UPMCD was created by <a href='https://github.com/cardboardchik'>karton4ik</a> as a replacement for Junior Achievement's MESE

# About MESE or Management and Economic Simulator Exercise

Mese is a management and economic modeling exercise. It is a computer program in which groups of players make decisions about the production and marketing of an imaginary product. During the simulation, players determine prices, production, marketing budgets, capital expenditures, and research and development (R&D) expenditures. The most successful teams will be those that best balance supply and demand, with the highest level of production and price. The program is designed to help students develop skills such as decision-making and teamwork, among other things.

MESE was created in the 1980s. It was widely used by JA (Junior Achievement) in its course JA Economics to teach students knowledge of company management and economic environment. There is also a web-based MESE variant called JA Titan. Unfortunately, the use of MESE / JA Titan was discontinued in 2013.

MESE dosen't run on 64-bit sistems. I added the <a href='https://github.com/cardboardchik/Mese_2022/tree/main/mese_old_ver'>old version of the program</a>.

To run the old version of the program, you need to find MESE.EXE and run it (only runs on 32-bit systems). I checked on Windows 7(32-bit), everything worked.
