# Mese_2022 or Management and Economic Simulator Exercise
Based on the Junior Achievement Management and Economic Simulator Exercise programm.
It dosen't run on 64-bit sistems.
Therefore, I decided to rewrite this programm in Python.

I also added the old version of the program.


To run the progtam, you need to find MESE.EXE and run it (only runs on 32-bit systems). I checked on Windows 7(32-bit), everything worked.
